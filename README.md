# IoT Lab session: Data analytics and machine learning in the cloud and edge for IoT

This repository is created for the IoT lab session on Data analytics and machine learning in the cloud and edge for IoT. It is composed from two session. During the first session, the students will have a brief introduction to cloud computing and how to containarize applications to be deployed in the cloud and in the edge. During the second session, the students will have also a brief introduction to machine learning, how to use pre-trained models for computer vision problems, and how to train models from a time-series data to forecast future values. 

## Containarized applications. 
The modules used during this session are within the folders helloworld and covid19_cases. During the theoretical part of the session, we will follow the getting started tutorial directly from docker. For that, it is highly recommended that the students have docker already installed and create a free account on docker hub. Then we will head to developing our first containarized application. The first example (helloworld) shows the differences between running your application locally at your computer and running an application inside a docker container. It is a really simple application but it allows to demonstrate the initial steps of developing application for the cloud. 

The second application (covid19_cases) is a dashboard-like application that displays some figures of the current situation of the covid19 pandemic in different countries around the world. This application is more complex than the first, but it follows the same patterns, showing the students the benefits of containers. This application also can be useful towards the final project.
